# TDX

This section contains the description of Quex approach to persistence and key management in TDX together with the
instructions for deploying your Trust Domain.

The instructions will guide you through the Quex toolchain for creating reproducible builds of the VMs, verifiying
measurements of TD registers, instantiating the per-VM private keys using Quex Vault, attesting your VM, and finally
running your service inside it as it was ordinary Docker container.
