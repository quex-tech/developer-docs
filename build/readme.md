## Building with Quex

This section provides a comprehensive guide for integrating Quex into your decentralized applications, covering the entire process from data retrieval and processing to securely accessing protected sources and bringing verified data on-chain. We begin by showing how HTTPS requests are certified within Quex, ensuring that data retrieved from off-chain sources is secure and trustworthy.

Next, we showcase the power of Quex's post-processing capabilities, which allow you to transform raw data into a format suitable for on-chain use. You'll learn how to extract specific values from JSON responses, convert them to integers, and perform complex calculations such as creating weighted indices. These features enable efficient and customized data handling, making it easy to prepare data for use directly within your smart contracts.

The section also covers how to securely handle credentials-protected data sources using encrypted patches. This ensures that sensitive information, such as API keys, remains hidden while allowing secure access to data. You'll learn how to configure requests so that private data stays confidential throughout the data retrieval process.

In the **On-Chain Integration** section, we bring all these elements together, demonstrating how to effectively use Quex's capabilities within your decentralized application. This includes building queries that incorporate all the registered components, verifying the cryptographic signatures to ensure data authenticity, and handling responses through smart contracts. We also discuss how to access data logs, manage feed updates, and interact with Quex's on-chain verification mechanisms, enabling your dApp to leverage secure, certified off-chain data for reliable, trustless operations.
