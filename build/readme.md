## Introduction

Quex's API enables developers to fetch data from various RESTful services, process the data using flexible post-processing options, and deliver it to the blockchain in a verifiable manner. The system's core components include querying data from external sources, applying filters for data transformation, and using cryptographic signatures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided.

In this section, you will learn how to:
- Select and connect to different data sources.
- Query data using the Quex API and transform it with post-processing filters.
- Access and securely handle credential-protected APIs.
- Verify data integrity on-chain using smart contracts.
- Manage data requests and integrate them with your dApps.

This guide aims to equip you with the tools and knowledge needed to effectively utilize Quex for decentralized applications, providing a secure and scalable solution for integrating off-chain data into Web3 environments.
