# Post-Processing

In this section, we explore how Quex allows you to perform verifiable post-processing on fetched data, making it more suitable for on-chain use by extracting relevant information and performing computations.

## Examples

[Extracting Integer Values](extract-int.md)
> Learn how to extract a specific price and convert it to an integer value for efficient on-chain processing.

[Index Calculation](index.md)
> See how to calculate a weighted index price using multiple assets and make the result available on-chain.
