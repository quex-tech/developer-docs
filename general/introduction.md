# Introduction

Here you can find the client documentation for Quex. Quex provides a protocol and infrastructure for decentralized data
transfer based on confidential computing (CC). Applications include receiving off-chain data, cross-chain messaging and
trusted off-chain code execution.

To get familiar with our approach and terminology, we strongly recommend having a look at [this overview](overview.md).

For the data consumers we have end-user solution capable of transfering and post-processing arbitrary JSON API data from
TLS-protected HTTP endpoints of your choice. More oracle pools are coming. If you are interested in trying our pool
immediately, check out [Getting Started](../consumer/getting_started2.md).

For the data providers we have the infrastructure, protocol and API for running CC-based oracle pools and public
on-chain data verification. To get an idea of running your own pool, please have a look at [Running Your Own
Pool](../provider/running_your_own_pool.md) and do not hesitate to contact us.
