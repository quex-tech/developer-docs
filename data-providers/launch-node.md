# Become a Data Provider

To run a Quex node, you need a dedicated server with Intel TDX (Trusted Domain Extensions) support. The Quex network is currently in a permissioned testnet stage, so if youâ€™re interested in becoming a data provider, please drop us an email at info@quex.tech for more information.

Before the public launch, this section will be updated to include detailed instructions on how to join the Quex network and become a data provider. Stay tuned for updates as we prepare for the transition to the public network.
