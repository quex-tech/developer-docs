[//]: # (Fourth, there's a step to define a [private patch]&#40;../https_pool/https_pool.md#httpprivatepatch&#41;â€”a field containing private data that will be passed within the TD in encrypted form and later on attached to the request. This is particularly useful for attaching API keys or security tokens to your requests. Creating flows with a non-empty private patch is slightly more challenging, so we've developed a [standalone tool]&#40;https://github.com/quex-tech/quex-v1-interfaces/tree/master/tools/create_flow&#41; to simplify the process of creating complex flows. However, since our current example doesn't require private data, we simply set the patch ID to zero: `bytes32 patchId = 0`.)
